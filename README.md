# Hey 👋 I'm Achraf Haddar Software Engineer living in Germany

I'm a 26-year-old tech enthusiast from Tunisia on a perpetual journey of exploration and learning. 
I can confidently say I have ventured into a wide array of technologies in the tech world. With over 2 years of experience, I've developed a knack for transforming ideas into tangible solutions in the IT industry. I work diligently in high-pressure situations and adapt quickly to changes. 

## What's in My Arsenal:

- **Version Control**: GitLab and GitHub are like old friends.
- **Languages**: Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, and HTML.
- **Front-End**: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Typescript and the delights of React.js, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, and Material UI.
- **Back-end**: I have experience with Node.js, Express, Spring Boot, Flask, and FastAPI.
- **Development Practices**: I play in the Agile sandbox, mastering Scrum, DevOps, and the art of code reviews.
- **Containerization**: Docker is my go-to for packaging up applications. Additionally, I orchestrate with Kubernetes for scalable container management.    
-   **CI/CD**: Jenkins and GitHub Actions automate my continuous integration and deployment pipelines.    
-   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: I shape my cloud infrastructure using Terraform, ensuring reproducibility and scalability.    
-   **Cloud Platforms**: Proficient in both AWS and Azure, harnessing the power of cloud services for dynamic and scalable solutions.
- **Databases**: Whether SQL (MySQL and PostgreSQL) or NoSQL (MongoDB), I can handle them.
- **Architectural Styles**: MVC and the intricate world of microservices.

## Constantly Curious

I'm like a sponge 🧽, eager to soak up new knowledge 🧠 and technologies 🔬. 
My eagerness to explore the unknown keeps me engaged and motivated to acquire new skills.

## A Problem Solver and Team Player

I thrive both in teamwork and when flying solo. Pressure and responsibility? Bring it on.
I don't just see myself as a programmer but rather as a problem solver. 
I love thinking outside the box 📦 and understand that mistakes are stepping stones to success 🚀. 
I'm not deterred by failures; instead, I embrace them as learning opportunities 📖. 
With a pinch of perseverance, I believe every challenge can be surmounted.

## Beyond the Keyboard

When I'm not immersed in technology, I find joy in watching football ⚽🏆 and playing tennis 🎾 during my free time. I'm also an avid movie and series enthusiast 📺🎬🍿.
